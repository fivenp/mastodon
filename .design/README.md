A collection of design contribution guidelines and resources for Mastodon.

> **These guides are very early stage â€“Â all participating designers are highly encouraged to shape and evolve these guidelines!**

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

We're thrilled you'd like to contribute design efforts towards Mastodon and would love to give you a brief guide on how to do so and where to find relevant resources.

Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server where users can follow friends and discover new ones. On Mastodon, users can publish anything they want: links, pictures, text, video.

## ðŸš¢ How to contribute design

1. Check out open [issues](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues) here on GitHub (we label them with `design: required`)
2. Feel free to open an issue on your own if you find something you would like to contribute to the project and use the `design: idea` label for it.
3. Clone the public Figma/Penpot files (available below) or create new ones and make sure to **share them publicly**.
4. Add your contributions to an issue and we promise we will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions

## ðŸš€ Mastodon web

Our web version can be found over here: https://joinmastodon.org
You can create an account for free on a server of your choice, login and discover it on your own.

The web version is a responsive, progressive WebApp â€“Â which you should keep in mind whenever you design for it.

### Design materials

There are currently multiple efforts to replicate the current design and flows in Figma and Penpot. 
We will update these documents while those resources evolve.

### Fonts

For now it seems we're using a custom font on the web which is mapped to Roboto 

Roboto is available on Google Fonts:

We'll provide a dedicated color palette for our themes very shortly... In the mean time please refer to our code, linked below.
